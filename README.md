# Compound Drought Stressors Drive Vegetation Decline in the African Great Lakes: A Multiscale Causal Analysis

## Overview

This study aims to identify the direct drivers and causal pathways of compound drought
impacts on vegetation productivity across the region. To address this, this study conducted
a comprehensive 25-year analysis (2000–2024) integrating satellite-derived vegetation indices
(NDVI) with key hydroclimatic variables, including precipitation, temperature, soil moisture
(SM), vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and teleconnections. Using a wavelet-based causal discovery
(PCMCI) framework, we move beyond correlation to identify the direct drivers of vegetation
stress.
## 🔍 Key Findings

- Causal analysis identifies the synergistic effect of soil moisture deficit and high atmospheric dryness (VPD), rather than precipitation or temperature anomalies alone, as the predominant direct driver of vegetation productivity decline in the study region.
- Croplands and shrublands are significantly more vulnerable to drought than forests.
- SM, VPD drive short-term stress, while large-scale teleconnections (like ENSO) drive longer-term changes in vegetation dynamics.

## 📈 Methods
- PCMCI causal discovery
- Wavelet decomposition (MODWT)
- 25-year NDVI, SM, VPD, precipitation analysis
