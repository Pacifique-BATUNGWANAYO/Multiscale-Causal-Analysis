# Compound Drought Stressors Drive Vegetation Decline in the African Great Lakes: A Multiscale Causal Analysis

## Overview

This study aims at identifying reliable data to be used in analysing climate change impacts on vegetation and agriculture across region of scarce data. To address this, this study conducted a comprehensive 25-year analysis (2000–2024) integrating satellite-derived vegetation indices (NDVI) with key hydroclimatic variables, including precipitation, temperature, soil moisture, vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and teleconnections. Using a wavelet-based causal discovery (PCMCI) framework, we move beyond correlation to identify the direct drivers of vegetation stress.
