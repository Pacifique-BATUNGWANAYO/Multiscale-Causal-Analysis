# Compound Drought Stressors Drive Vegetation Decline in the African Great Lakes: A Multiscale Causal Analysis

## Overview

This study aims to identify the direct drivers and causal pathways of compound drought
impacts on vegetation productivity across the region. To address this, this study conducted
a comprehensive 25-year analysis (2000–2024) integrating satellite-derived vegetation indices
(NDVI) with key hydroclimatic variables, including precipitation, temperature, soil moisture
(SM), vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and teleconnections. Using a wavelet-based causal discovery
(PCMCI) framework, we move beyond correlation to identify the direct drivers of vegetation
stress.
